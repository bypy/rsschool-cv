## Summary
I have established myself as a mid-level integration developer for the last three years,\
but further perspective has certain problems. So I don't mind to change a job next year.

Web development has resonated with me because it lays in creative domain between graphic design and programming.

For the time of work as an enterprise service bus developer and receiving additional education in the field of front-end and back-end development I brought up perseverance and responsibility.
